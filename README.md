## A Data Visualization Project! ##
The aim of this project is to provide a creative way to read a clock, accurate within a quarter hour (EST)
Access it here: https://emiilyxiia.github.io/space-clock/

I used p5.js and html to complete this project. This resource was especially helpful: https://p5js.org/

- AM/PM Hours are represented by 12 yellow/blue moons respectively.
- Minutes (in groups of 10 for easy visualization) are represented by stars. So 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-29, 40-49, 50-59 for a total of 6 stars.
- Seconds are represented by space dust.

Enjoy!
