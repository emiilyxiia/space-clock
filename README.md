A Data Visualization Project!
Access it here: https://emiilyxiia.github.io/space-clock/

I used p5.js and html to complete this project. This resource was especially helpful: https://p5js.org/

- AM/PM Hours are represented by yellow/blue moons respectively.
- Minutes (in groups of 10 for easy visualization) are represented by stars.
- Seconds are represented by space dust.

The aim of this project is to provide a creative way to read a clock, accurate within a quarter hour. Enjoy!
